# API-to-MCP Transformation Tool â€” Requirements Document

## Overviews

The API-to-MCP Transformation Tool is designed to automate the process of converting any given API (Python or otherwise) into a format compatible with the MCP (Modular Command Platform) system. The tool will take as input a description of the target API, interact with the API to obtain sample responses, and then transform these responses into a standardized JSON format with fields required by MCP.

## Goals

- **Automate** the transformation of arbitrary APIs into MCP-compatible modules.
- **Minimize manual intervention** by inferring data structures and required fields from API usage and responses.
- **Support** a wide range of API response formats (e.g., Python dataclasses, dictionaries, JSON, etc.).
- **Output** a standardized JSON structure with fields required by MCP.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Input Specification

- The tool accepts a description of the API to be transformed. This may include:
  - Example usage code (e.g., from documentation or web pages).
  - API endpoint details (if HTTP-based).
  - Expected input parameters and their types.
  - Expected output format (dataclass, dict, JSON, etc.).

### 2. API Interaction

- The tool should be able to:
  - Parse the example usage and execute it in a sandboxed environment.
  - Make a real or simulated request to the API using the provided parameters.
  - Capture the response, regardless of its format (dataclass, dict, JSON, etc.).

### 3. Response Normalization

- The tool must:
  - Detect the structure of the API response.
  - Convert the response into a Python dictionary (if not already).
  - Serialize the dictionary into JSON.

### 4. MCP Field Mapping

- The tool should:
  - Map the fields of the API response to the required MCP fields.
  - Allow for configuration or inference of field mappings (e.g., via a mapping file or interactive prompt).
  - Validate that all required MCP fields are present in the output.

### 5. Output Generation

- The tool outputs:
  - A JSON file (or files) containing the transformed data in MCP-compatible format.
  - Optionally, a Python module or script that wraps the API and performs the transformation automatically.

### 6. Extensibility

- The tool should be designed to support:
  - Additional API types and response formats in the future.
  - Custom transformation logic via plugins or configuration.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** The tool should be easy to use, with clear documentation and examples.
- **Security:** Execution of API code should be sandboxed to prevent malicious code execution.
- **Performance:** The tool should process typical API responses in under 2 seconds.
- **Portability:** The tool should run on all major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).

## Example Workflow

1. **User provides** an API description and example usage (e.g., from [fast-flights documentation](mdc:https:/aweirddev.github.io/flights/index.html)).
2. **Tool parses** the example, executes the API call, and captures the response.
3. **Tool converts** the response to a Python dict and then to JSON.
4. **Tool maps** the response fields to MCP-required fields.
5. **Tool outputs** the MCP-compatible JSON file and/or a Python wrapper.

## Out of Scope

- The tool does not guarantee semantic correctness of field mappings without user input.
- The tool does not handle APIs requiring complex authentication or non-Python environments (for the initial version).
