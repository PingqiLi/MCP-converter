# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Produce self-contained Python tool classes for each API, inheriting from MCPTool.
# Details:
Automatically generate Python classes in generated_tools/ for each API, inheriting from MCPTool. Include required interface methods and attributes. Ensure classes are ready for use in MCP.

# Test Strategy:
Test generated classes for correct inheritance and interface implementation. Verify instantiation and method calls.
