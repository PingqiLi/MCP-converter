# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and CLI Entry Point
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project structure and create a CLI entry point (main.py) for user interaction.
# Details:
Create a new Python project with a standard structure (src/, tests/, generated_tools/). Implement main.py as the CLI entry point, using argparse or click for command-line argument parsing. Ensure the project is ready for further module development.

# Test Strategy:
Test CLI entry point by running main.py with --help and verifying it outputs usage instructions. Check project structure for required directories.
