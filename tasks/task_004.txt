# Title: Build Response Normalization and Serialization Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Normalize and serialize API responses into Python dictionaries and JSON.
# Details:
Create normalizer.py to convert API responses (dataclass, dict, JSON) into Python dictionaries. Implement serialization to JSON. Handle edge cases for different response formats.
