# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Sandboxed Execution Environment for API Calls
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Build a secure environment to execute API calls safely.
# Details:
Implement sandbox.py to execute API calls in a restricted environment. Use subprocess or a containerized approach (e.g., Docker) to isolate execution. Ensure environment variables and network access are controlled.

# Test Strategy:
Test sandbox execution with sample API calls. Verify isolation and error handling for unsafe operations.
