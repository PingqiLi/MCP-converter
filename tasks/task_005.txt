# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Field Mapping Engine with Configurable/Inferable Mapping
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a module to map API response fields to required MCP fields.
# Details:
Implement field_mapper.py to support both configurable (user-provided) and inferable (automatic) field mapping. Allow interactive mapping configuration via CLI. Store mapping rules for reuse.

# Test Strategy:
Test mapping with sample API responses and mapping configurations. Verify output matches expected MCP field structure.
