from fast_flights import FlightData, Passengers, Result, get_flights

result = get_flights(
    flight_data=[FlightData(date="2025-01-01", from_airport="TPE", to_airport="MYJ")],
    trip="one-way",
    seat="economy", 
    passengers=Passengers(adults=2, children=1, infants_in_seat=0, infants_on_lap=0),
    fetch_mode="fallback"
