# Overview
The API-to-MCP Transformation Tool converts any API (Python or otherwise) into a format compatible with the MCP (Modular Command Platform) system. It automates integration by inferring data structures and required fields from API usage and responses, supporting a wide range of response formats, and outputting standardized JSON and Python classes for MCP. The tool is for developers and integrators who need to quickly adapt third-party APIs for MCP.

# Task List
- Set up the project structure and create a CLI entry point (e.g., main.py)
- Implement an input parser for API descriptions and usage code (input_parser.py)
- Develop a sandboxed execution environment for API calls (sandbox.py)
- Build response normalization and serialization logic (normalizer.py)
- Create a field mapping engine with configurable/inferable mapping (field_mapper.py)
- Implement MCP field validation logic (validator.py)
- Develop an output generator for MCP-compatible JSON (output_generator.py)
- Design and implement a base APIClient class (apiclient.py) with methods: execute, get_schema
- Design and implement a base MCPTool class (mcp_tool.py) with methods: run, validate, and required class attributes (name, description, parameters_schema)
- Generate a folder (e.g., generated_tools/) containing self-contained, standardized Python tool classes for each API, inheriting from MCPTool
- Write an example tool class (WeatherTool) in generated_tools/ that inherits from MCPTool and implements the required interface
- Add optional Python wrapper generation for the API transformation
- Add extensibility hooks for new API types/response formats
- Write documentation and usage examples (README.md)
- Test all core features and flows with unit and integration tests (tests/)


# Acceptance Criteria
- Each task results in a concrete, testable deliverable (file, class, or folder)
- The generated_tools/ folder contains at least one working example tool class (WeatherTool) inheriting from MCPTool
- All abstractions (APIClient, MCPTool) are implemented as Python base classes and used by generated tools
- The CLI can run end-to-end: from API description input to generation of MCP-compatible tool classes and JSON
- Documentation and tests are present and verifiable

# Core Features
- Implement a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction
- Parse API descriptions and example usage code provided by the user
- Execute API calls in a secure, sandboxed environment
- Capture and normalize API responses (dataclass, dict, JSON) into Python dictionaries
- Serialize normalized responses into JSON
- Map API response fields to required MCP fields (configurable/inferable mapping)
- Validate that all required MCP fields are present in the output
- Output MCP-compatible JSON files
- Generate a folder containing standardized, self-contained Python class definitions for each tool, following a base abstraction (e.g., MCPTool)
- Implement base Python abstractions for API clients (APIClient) and MCP tools (MCPTool) to ensure extensibility and standardization
- Optionally generate a Python wrapper module for the API transformation
- Support extensibility for additional API types and response formats

# User Experience
- CLI prompts for API description, usage code, and mapping configuration
- Clear error messages and usage documentation
- Option for interactive mapping configuration
- After execution, user receives a folder with ready-to-use, standardized Python tool classes

# Technical Architecture
- Input parser for API descriptions and usage examples
- Sandboxed execution environment for safe API calls
- Response normalizer and serializer
- Field mapping engine (configurable/inferable)
- Output generator for JSON and Python modules
- Base abstractions:
  - `APIClient` (abstract base class for all API integrations)
  - `MCPTool` (abstract base class for all MCP tool definitions)

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Project structure and CLI must be set up first
- Input parser and sandboxed execution are foundational
- Response normalization depends on successful API execution
- Field mapping and validation require normalized responses
- Output generation depends on field mapping and validation
- Base abstractions must be defined before generating concrete tool classes
- Extensibility and wrapper generation are layered after core features

# Risks and Mitigations
- Sandboxing and safe execution: Use proven libraries and restrict environment
- MVP scope: Focus on Python APIs and basic mapping for first version
- Performance/portability: Optimize for typical API response sizes and support major platforms
